# Hi, I'm Keanan Scarbro!

I'm a physics graduate student at North Carolina State University interested in theoretical particle and nuclear physics, especially areas involving quantum field theory (QFT), quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and computational modeling.

Alongside my academic work, I build tools and simulations that explore physical systems — from cytoskeletal network dynamics to quantum mechanical models — often using Python, NumPy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib. I enjoy coding and have also created hobby projects including games, webbots, and websites.

I'm always eager to deepen my understanding of physics and computation, and I use this space to share what I’ve learned — and what I’m still learning — through projects and tools.
